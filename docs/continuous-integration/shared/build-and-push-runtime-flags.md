**Build and Push** steps use plugins to complete build and push operations. With Kubernetes cluster build infrastructures, these steps use [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko/blob/main/README.md), and, with other build infrastructures, these steps use [drone-docker](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-docker/blob/master/README.md).

These plugins have a number of additional runtime flags that you might need for certain use cases. For information about the flags, go to the [kaniko plugin documentation](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko/blob/main/README.md#additional-flags) and the [drone-docker plugin documentation](https://plugins.drone.io/plugins/docker).

In **Build and Push** steps, you use the **Environment Variables** setting to set these plugin runtime flags. You must input a **Name** and **Value** for each variable. Format the name as `PLUGIN_FLAG_NAME`.

:::warning

Unlike in other Harness CI steps, the **Environment Variables** setting in **Build and Push** steps *only* accepts the known plugin runtime flags. You must set other types of environment variables in your Dockerfile, build arguments, or as stage variables, depending on their usage and purpose in your build.

<summary>YAML example: Build and Push step with environment variables</summary>

This YAML example shows a Build and Push to GAR step with `PLUGIN` environment variables.

```yaml
              - step:
                  identifier: pushGCR
                  name: push GCR
                  type: BuildAndPushGAR ## Type depends the selected Build and Push step, such as Docker, GAR, ACR, and so on.
                  spec: ## Some parts of 'step.spec' vary by Build and Push step type (Docker, GAR, ACR, etc).
                    connectorRef: YOUR_GCR_CONNECTOR
                    host: "us.gcr.io"
                    projectID: "some-gcp-project"
                    imageName: "some-image-name"
                    tags:
                      - "1.0"
                      - "1.2"
                    buildArgs:
                      foo: bar
                      hello: world
                    labels:
                      foo: bar
                      hello: world
                    target: dev-env
                    context: "."
                    dockerfile: "harnessDockerfile"
                    remoteCacheImage: "test/cache"
                    envVariables: ## Specify plugin runtime flags as environment variables under 'step.spec'.
                      PLUGIN_TAR_PATH: ./harnesstarpath
                      PLUGIN_IMAGE_DOWNLOAD_RETRY: "2"
                      PLUGIN_COMPRESSED_CACHING: "false"
                      PLUGIN_USE_NEW_RUN: "true"
                      PLUGIN_GARBAGE: yoyo
```

For example, to set `--skip-tls-verify` for kaniko, add an environment variable named `PLUGIN_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY` and set the variable value to `true`.

```yaml
              - step:
                  identifier: buildandpush
                  name: buildandpush
                  type: BuildAndPush---
                  spec:
                    ...
                    envVariables:
                      PLUGIN_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY: true
```

To set `custom_dns` for drone-docker, add an environment variable named `PLUGIN_CUSTOM_DNS` and set the variable value to your custom DNS address.

```yaml
                    envVariables:
                      PLUGIN_CUSTOM_DNS: "vvv.xxx.yyy.zzz"
```

Plugin runtime flags are also used to [build without pushing](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-without-push).

:::info Stage variables

Previously, you could set some plugin runtime flags as [stage variables](/docs/platform/pipelines/add-a-stage/#stage-variables). If you had done this, Harness recommends moving these stage variables to the **Environment Variables** in your **Build and Push** step.

For other types of environment variables (that aren't Build and Push plugin runtime flags), stage variables are still inherently available to steps as environment variables. However, where you declare environment variables depends on their usage and purpose in your build. You might need to set them in your Dockerfile, build args, or otherwise.
