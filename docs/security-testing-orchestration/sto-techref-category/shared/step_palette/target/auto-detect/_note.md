Note the following:
- This option is behind the Feature Flag `STO_AUTO_TARGET_NAME_VARIANT`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable it. <!-- (STO-6704) -->
- Auto-detection is not available when the **Scan Mode** is Ingestion. 
- Auto-detect is the default selection for new pipelines. Manual is the default for old pipelines, but you might find that neither radio button is selected in the UI.
