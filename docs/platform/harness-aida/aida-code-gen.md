Code Generation with AIDA is an IDE plugin. It is currently in development. Check back soon for more details.

## Technical framework of Harness AIDA Code Assistant

At the core of Harness AIDA Code Assistant's functionality is its sophisticated use of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are trained on vast datasets of code to understand and generate human-like code. These LLMs include but are not limited to OpenAI GPT models like GPT 3.5turbo and GPT 4.0. This allows Harness AIDA Code Assistant to offer contextually relevant code suggestions, explanations, and test generation.

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE) extension

Harness AIDA Code Assistant functions as an extension for popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). This design choice ensures that developers can use Harness AIDA Code Assistant's features without leaving their familiar coding environment. The extension is built to be lightweight and responsive, providing suggestions in real-time as developers type. It supports a wide range of programming languages, making it versatile across different development contexts.

### Agent-based context collection

To provide relevant suggestions, Harness AIDA Code Assistant employs an agent-based approach for context collection. This involves analyzing the current codebase, open files, and cursor position to understand the developer's intent and the task at hand. By gathering this context, Harness AIDA Code Assistant can tailor its suggestions to fit the specific requirements of the code being written.

### Enriched context through static code analysis

Further enhancing its context-aware capabilities, Harness AIDA Code Assistant incorporates static code analysis to understand the structure and semantics of the code. This analysis allows Harness AIDA Code Assistant to identify contextually relevant code that may live far from the file that is currently being edited

### Fetching external documentation (WIP)

Recognizing the importance of accurate documentation, Harness AIDA Code Assistant includes a feature to fetch relevant external documentation. Whether it's official language documentation, framework guides, or community-contributed notes, Harness AIDA Code Assistant can present this information directly within the IDE. This saves developers time and ensures that they have access to the information they need when they need it.

### Model-based solution for optimal prompt finding (WIP)

At the heart of Harness AIDA Code Assistant's effectiveness is its model-based approach for finding the optimal prompt for the LLM. By carefully crafting prompts based on the collected context and static analysis, Harness AIDA Code Assistant ensures that the suggestions provided are both relevant and accurate. This approach maximizes the utility of the LLM, enabling it to generate high-quality code completions and other development aids.
This technical framework sets Harness AIDA Code Assistant apart as a comprehensive tool that addresses the multifaceted challenges of software development. By leveraging AI in these innovative ways, Harness AIDA Code Assistant not only enhances developer productivity but also contributes to the creation of higher quality software.

## Usage and implementation of Harness AIDA Code Assistant

Integrating Harness AIDA Code Assistant into the software development workflow is a straightforward process designed to minimize setup time and maximize efficiency. This section outlines the steps to implement Harness AIDA Code Assistant and demonstrates its practical use in everyday coding tasks.

### Setting up the IDE extension

The extension is currently only available to our alpha partners. To begin using Harness AIDA Code Assistant, developers first install the extension from their IDE's marketplace. This process is similar to adding any other IDE plugin, ensuring ease of adoption. Once installed, developers can configure the extension settings to tailor Harness AIDA Code Assistant's behavior to their preferences, such as specifying which programming languages to activate it for or adjusting the sensitivity of its suggestions.

### Securing API access

Harness AIDA Code Assistant requires access to its AI model through Harness Gateway. This token ensures secure communication between the IDE extension and Harness AIDA Code Assistant's servers, safeguarding the code and the developer's intellectual property. The setup guide provides detailed instructions on obtaining and configuring the API token within the IDE.

### Real-world coding scenarios

With Harness AIDA Code Assistant activated, developers can start leveraging its features to streamline their coding tasks. For example, when writing new functions, Harness AIDA Code Assistant can suggest complete blocks of code that adhere to best practices, significantly reducing the time required to write boilerplate code. In debugging sessions, Harness AIDA Code Assistant can suggest potential fixes or even generate unit tests to cover edge cases that the developer might not have considered.
